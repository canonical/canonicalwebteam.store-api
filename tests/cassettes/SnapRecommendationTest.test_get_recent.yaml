        the package registry to publish it for docker, npm and many other package
        managers.\n* Customizable: Want to change your look? Change some settings?
        There are many config switches to make Forgejo work exactly like you want.\n*

        is the notes app built for handwriting.\n\n\n\nIt''s designed to be as simple
        and intuitive as possible, while still delivering unique features that you''ll
        actually use. Additionally, Saber is available across all your devices, large
        and small, and syncs between them seamlessly.\n\n\n\nNotably, it can invert
        your notes when you''re in dark mode. This allows you to write with white
        ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments
        like when the teacher turns off the lights in class.\nImages and PDFs are
        also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without
        the fuss.\n\n\n\nSaber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from
        anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can
        safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even
        host your own!\n\n\n\nThe app is completely open-source so that anyone can
        view the source code and see exactly what it''s doing and how it handles your
        data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning
        that their inner workings are a mystery to the public.\n\n\n\nAs someone who
        studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with
        other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with
        itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would
        render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read.\nSaber''s
        highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the
        highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper,
        where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency.\n\n\n\nSaber has
        everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders
        inside folders to your heart''s content with no limit on the number of nested
        folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder,
        you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available
        on the home screen.\n\n\n\nDiscover a whole new way to capture and organize
        your thoughts\nwith Saber. Whether you''re a student, professional, or creative\nmind,
        Saber is your trusted companion for digital handwriting.\nDownload now and
        let your ideas flow freely!","developer_validation":"starred","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2024/09/ic_launcher-playstore.png","last_updated":"Tue,

        is an Open Source tool for the analysis and visualization of mass spectrometric
        and chromatographic data developed by Lablicate GmbH.\n\nData from different
        systems can be imported and analyzed, hence it\u2019s a vendor independent
        software. Originally, the intention was to create a ChemStation alternative.
        Meanwhile, it has become much more. Generally, it supports handling GC/MS,
        GC/FID, HPLC-UV/VIS, FTIR, PCR and NMR data. Originally, OpenChrom\u00ae was
        designed to analyze data from analytical pyrolysis, called Py-GC/MS. Thus,
        it has a strong focus on chromatography and nominal mass spectrometry.\n\n
        In the course of time, additional requirements have been added. More features
        are already in the pipeline. Its strength is to handle GC/MS and GC/FID measurements.
        Methods for peak detection, integration, identification, quantitation and
        reporting are supported. Using internal (ISTD) and external standards (ESTD)
        for quantitation purposes is supported as well. Additional filter help to
        optimize the measurements and classifier calculate key values of the chromatographic
        data and help to point out problems like shifted retention times or degraded
        columns.\n\nDid you know that it is easy to detect and identify peaks in a
        GC/MS file and to transfer these peaks to its corresponding GC/FID measurement
        for quantitation purposes? In summary, the modularity of OpenChrom\u00ae allows
        recombining the contained functionality for many different purposes. Both
        working in target screening (TS) and non-target screening (NTS) mode is possible.
        Therefore, the platform can be utilized for quality control purposes or for
        the analysis of chromatographic fingerprints.\n\nWhile the base version is

        tool and library for generating a Software Bill of Materials from container
        images and filesystems\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSyft is a powerful and easy-to-use
        open-source tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container
        images and filesystems. It provides detailed visibility into the packages
        and dependencies in your software, helping you manage vulnerabilities, license
        compliance, and software supply chain security.\n\nSyft development is sponsored
        by Anchore, and is released under the Apache-2.0 License. For commercial support
        options with Syft or Grype, please contact Anchore.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nTo
        generate an SBOM for a container image:\n\n   syft <image>\n\nThe above output
        includes only software that is visible in the container (i.e., the squashed
        representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in
        the SBOM, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope
        all-layers`:\n\n   syft <image> --scope all-layers\n\n**Output Formats**\n\nThe
        output format for Syft is configurable as well using the `-o` (or `--output`)
        option:\n\n   syft <image> -o <format>\n\nWhere the `formats` available are:\n\n*
        syft-json: Use this to get as much information out of Syft as possible!\n*
        syft-text: A row-oriented, human-and-machine-friendly output.\n* cyclonedx-xml:

        A JSON report conforming to the CycloneDX 1.6 specification.\n* cyclonedx-json@1.5:
        A JSON report conforming to the CycloneDX 1.5 specification.\n* spdx-tag-value:
        A tag-value formatted report conforming to the SPDX 2.3 specification.\n*
        spdx-tag-value@2.2: A tag-value formatted report conforming to the SPDX 2.2
        specification.\n* spdx-json: A JSON report conforming to the SPDX 2.3 JSON
        Schema.\n* spdx-json@2.2: A JSON report conforming to the SPDX 2.2 JSON Schema.\n*
        github-json: A JSON report conforming to GitHub''s dependency snapshot format.\n*
        syft-table: A columnar summary (default).\n* template: Lets the user specify
        the output format. See \"Using templates\" below.\n\nNote that flags using
        the @ can be used for earlier versions of each specification as well.\n\n**Supported
        Ecosystems**\n\n- Alpine (apk)\n- C (conan)\n- C++ (conan)\n- Dart (pubs)\n-

        let us know using the issue tracker.\n\n**Installation**\n\n   snap install
        grype\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nTo scan for vulnerabilities in an image:\n\n   grype
        <image>\n\nThe above command scans for vulnerabilities that are visible in
        the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include
        software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its
        presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:\n\n   grype <image>
        --scope all-layers\n\n**Supported sources**\n\nGrype can scan a variety of
        sources beyond those found in Docker.\n\n   # scan a container image archive
        (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo
        copy` commands)\n   grype path/to/image.tar\n\n   # scan a Singularity Image
        Format (SIF) container\n   grype path/to/image.sif\n\n   # scan a directory\n   grype
        dir:path/to/dir\n\nSources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:\n\n   podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use
        images from the Podman daemon\n   docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use
        images from the Docker daemon\n   docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use
        a tarball from disk for archives created from \"docker save\"\n   oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use
        a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)\n   oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read
        directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)\n   singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read
        directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk\n   dir:path/to/yourproject                read
        directly from a path on disk (any directory)\n   sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read
        Syft JSON from path on disk\n   registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull
        image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)\n\nIf an image
        source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it
        is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon. If docker is
        not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching
        out directly to the image registry last.\n\n**Output Formats**\n\nThe output
        format for Grype is configurable as well:\n\n   grype <image> -o <format>\n\nWhere
        the formats available are:\n\n* `table`: A columnar summary (default).\n*
        `cyclonedx`: An XML report conforming to the CycloneDX 1.6 specification.\n*
        `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the CycloneDX 1.6 specification.\n*
        `json`: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!\n* `sarif`:
        Use this option to get a SARIF report (Static Analysis Results Interchange
        Format)\n* `template`: Lets the user specify the output format.\n\n**Documentation**\n\nOur

        Used by millions worldwide, our email application protects your\ncommunications
        and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\n**The Wall Street
        Journal says:**\n\n\"Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually
        impossible for\nanyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.\"\n\n**With
        the Proton Mail desktop application, you can:**\n\n* Manage your Proton Mail
        and Calendar from one application\n* Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n*
        Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n* Keep your inbox
        tidy and clean with folders, labels and with different views\n* Stay productive
        with native desktop notifications\n* Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n*
        Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\n**Why use Proton Mail?**\n\n* Easy to use
        -- Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to\n    read, organize,
        and write your emails.\n* Your inbox is yours -- We don''t spy on your communications
        to show you\n    targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n* Rigorous encryption
        -- Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No\n    one can read
        your emails but you.\n* Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access

        spying/tracking\n    protection for all your communications.\n\n**Industry
        Leading Security Features**\n\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers
        using end-to-end encryption at all\ntimes and are transmitted securely between
        Proton servers and user devices.\nThis largely eliminates the risk of message
        interception.\n\n**Zero Access to Your Email Content**\n\nProton Mail''s zero
        access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a\nway that makes
        it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side\nusing an encryption
        key that Proton does not have access to. This means we\ndon''t have the technical
        ability to decrypt your messages.\n\n**Open-Source Cryptography**\n\nProton
        Mail''s open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security\nexperts
        from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection.\nProton
        Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP,\nwhile
        all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using\nopen-source
        libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption\nalgorithms used

        is a high level, high performance, dynamic language for technical computing.\n\nJulia

        via LLVM.\n\nJulia is **general**: It uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm,
        making it easy to express object oriented and functional programming patterns.
        The standard library provides asynchronous I/O, process control, logging,
        profiling, a package manager, and more. In addition, there is a rich ecosystem
        of over 10,000 packages and counting across a number of domains.\n\nJulia
        is **easy to use**: It has high level syntax and is dynamically typed, providing
        accessibility for programmers of all backgrounds and experience levels, and
        making it feel like a scripting language.\n\nJulia is **optionally typed**:
        It has an extensive, flexible, and extensible type system, and type declarations
        can be used to clarify and solidify programs. But type declarations are not
        required for general use.\n\nJulia is **open source**: It''s free for anyone

        Network Monitoring and Management**\n\nDomotz is a cloud-based platform that
        helps you discover, monitor, and\nmanage your network and connected devices
        without overspending. With\nfull-context visibility and powerful management
        tools, Domotz helps you\neliminate blind spots, resolve issues faster, and
        exceed service\nexpectations.\n\n**Subscription Requirement**\\\nDomotz requires
        a subscription as described at\nhttp://www.domotz.com/. View transparent pricing
        at\nhttp://www.domotz.com/pricing.\n\n**Why Domotz?**\n\nToday''s networks
        are complex, distributed, and packed with connected\ndevices. Without proper
        monitoring, IT teams are left reacting to\nissues, wasting time troubleshooting
        blind spots, and putting out fires.\n\nDomotz gives you complete visibility
        into every device and connection.\nWith features like real-time alerts, remote
        access, and visual network\ntopology, you can quickly identify and resolve
        problems, often before\nanyone notices.\n\nSpend less time in crisis mode
        and more time ensuring stability and\nsatisfaction.\n\n**Try Domotz for free
        and access the full feature set:**\n\n- **Device Discovery & Inventory**\\\n  Automatically
        identifies all connected devices and builds a\n  comprehensive inventory.\n-
        **Network Topology Mapping**\\\n  Visualizes how devices are connected for
        easier navigation and faster\n  troubleshooting.\n- **Real-Time Alerts**\\\n  Notifies
        you when devices go offline, new ones connect, or performance\n  degrades.\n-
        **Remote Access**\\\n  Securely connect to devices using HTTP, SSH, RDP, Telnet---no
        open\n  ports needed.\n- **Power Management**\\\n  Power cycle devices remotely
        using PoE switches, PDUs, or Wake-on-LAN.\n- **SNMP & TCP Monitoring**\\\n  Monitor
        SNMP metrics and TCP services for deeper insights.\n- **Custom Scripting**\\\n  Automate
        tasks or trigger actions using customizable scripts.\n- **Configuration Management**\\\n  Backup
        and restore device configurations to streamline recovery and\n  consistency.\n-
        **Network Diagnostics**\\\n  Includes tools like traceroute, latency tracking,
        DHCP monitoring,\n  bufferbloat, bandwidth analysis, and speed tests.\n- **Camera
        Access (ONVIF)**\\\n  Stream or capture snapshots from IP cameras---no reconfiguring\n  firewalls.\n\n**Why
        Domotz Stands Out**\n\n- **Accessible**\\\n  Agentless deployment in under
        15 minutes. Easy to evaluate, implement,\n  and maintain at an affordable
        price.\n- **Deeper Discovery**\\\n  Combines Layer-2 and Layer 3 scanning
        for more accurate device\n  identification and visibility.\n- **True Management**\\\n  Go
        beyond monitoring with robust management tools and a custom\n  scripting framework.\n-
        **Centralized Dashboard**\\\n  Manage all your networks and devices from a
        single, unified\n  interface---anywhere in the world.\n- **Built for Security**\\\n  ISO/IEC
        27001 and SOC 2 Type II certified. Domotz uses strict\n  controls, encrypted
        communications, and continuous monitoring to\n  protect your data.\n\n**Installation
        notes** \n\nPlease connect the following interfaces:\n\n* sudo snap connect
        domotzpro-agent-publicstore:firewall-control\n* sudo snap connect domotzpro-agent-publicstore:network-observe\n*
        sudo snap connect domotzpro-agent-publicstore:raw-usb\n* sudo snap connect
        domotzpro-agent-publicstore:shutdown\n* sudo snap connect domotzpro-agent-publicstore:system-observe\n\nThen,
        click on the Domotz icon or go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 to configure the Domotz
        Collector. Note: if TCP port 3000 has been already used by a different service,
        Collector Web Interface might be available on subsequent ports (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:3001,
        http://127.0.0.1:3002, etc)\n\n**Additional notes**\n\nIn case you want to
        use the VPN on demand feature, you have to execute also:\n* sudo sh -c ''echo
        tun >> /etc/modules''\n* sudo modprobe tun\n\nIn case Uncomplicated Firewall
        (UFW) is configured on your machine, you might consider allowing the usage
        of the port where the Collector Web Interface is available. For instance running
        the following command:\n* sudo ufw allow 3000","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2019/03/new_domotz_icon.png","last_updated":"Fri,

        instant messaging \u2014 simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your
        devices. One of the world''s top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million
        active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market,
        connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around
        the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets
        and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don\u2019t need
        to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message
        from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media
        and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history
        will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in
        the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission
        to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram,
        including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit
        symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman
        secure key exchange.\n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented
        and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove
        the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.\n\nPOWERFUL:
        You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos,
        documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even
        set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online
        communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your
        messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging
        system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.\n\nFUN:
        Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and
        emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and
        an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE:
        While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to
        keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use
        it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third
        parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received
        for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your
        data to show you ads.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can
        do with a messaging app. Don\u2019t wait years for older messengers to catch
        up with Telegram \u2014 join the revolution today.","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2018/02/icon256.png","last_updated":"Wed,
