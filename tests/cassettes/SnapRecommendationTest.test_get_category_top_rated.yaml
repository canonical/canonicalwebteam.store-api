        devices. One of the world''s top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million
        active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market,
        connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around
        the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets
        and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don\u2019t need
        to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message
        from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media
        and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history
        will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in
        the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission
        to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram,
        including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit
        symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman
        secure key exchange.\n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented
        and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove
        the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.\n\nPOWERFUL:
        You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos,
        documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even
        set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online
        communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your
        messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging
        system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.\n\nFUN:
        Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and
        emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and
        an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE:
        While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to
        keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use
        it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third
        parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received
        for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your
        data to show you ads.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can
        do with a messaging app. Don\u2019t wait years for older messengers to catch
        up with Telegram \u2014 join the revolution today.","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2018/02/icon256.png","last_updated":"Wed,

        builds from the latest master commit. Use this to test new features. Might
        be unstable.\n- `beta` contains automated weekly promotions from edge. Use
        this if you want edge with fewer updates.\n- `candidate` contains release
        candidate (RC) builds. Use this if you want to test release candidates before
        a major release.\n\n\n**Apps/Commands**\n\nThere are multiple apps/commands
        included in the snap:\n\n- `freecad`:               Run FreeCAD\n- `freecad.cmd`:      Run
        FreeCAD command line interface\n- `freecad.pip`:        Install python packages
        for user (not system-wide).  \n                       E.g. `freecad.pip install
        py_slvs` for Assembly3. \n\n\nSide note: There is a FreeCAD experimental branch
        called ''Link branch'' created by a user named ''realthunder'' that has become
        popular. It is available as a Snap package named `freecad-realthunder` (https://snapcraft.io/freecad-realthunder).","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2024/09/FreeCAD_Logo.svg.png","last_updated":"Sat,

        A.D. (pronounced \u201czero-ey-dee\u201d) is a free, open-source, historical\nReal
        Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire Games,\na
        global group of volunteer game developers.\nAs the leader of an ancient civilization,
        you must gather the resources\nyou need to raise a military force and dominate
        your enemies.\n.\n\u201c0 A.D.\u201d is a time period that never actually
        existed: In the usual calendar,\none goes from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. and skips
        zero. This reflects the historical\nfiction in the game: Who would have won
        if all the factions were pitted\nagainst each other when each of them was
        at its prime?\n.\nWe intend to portray some of the major civilizations over
        the millennium of\n500 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Hence the midpoint, zero.) That is
        an ambitious prospect,\nso in the first edition of 0 A.D. we focus on the
        last five centuries B.C.\nPerhaps in future expansion packs, more civilizations
        will be added,\nalong with additional gameplay features.\n.\nWe put a strong
        emphasis on historical accuracy while developing 0 A.D.\nWe plan all our units
        and all our buildings based on reconstructions of how\nthe units and the buildings
        might have looked like in the ancient world.\nWe even name them in the original
        languages, such as Greek and Latin.\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that
        any game should be fun to play, so,\nin many cases, we preferred playability
        over historical accuracy.","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2017/12/icon256_f9302jP.png","last_updated":"Tue,

        your conversations private. Proton Mail is encrypted email from\nSwitzerland.
        Used by millions worldwide, our email application protects your\ncommunications
        and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\n**The Wall Street
        Journal says:**\n\n\"Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually
        impossible for\nanyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.\"\n\n**With
        the Proton Mail desktop application, you can:**\n\n* Manage your Proton Mail
        and Calendar from one application\n* Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n*
        Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n* Keep your inbox
        tidy and clean with folders, labels and with different views\n* Stay productive
        with native desktop notifications\n* Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n*
        Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\n**Why use Proton Mail?**\n\n* Easy to use
        -- Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to\n    read, organize,
        and write your emails.\n* Your inbox is yours -- We don''t spy on your communications
        to show you\n    targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n* Rigorous encryption
        -- Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No\n    one can read
        your emails but you.\n* Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access
        encryption.\n* Unmatched protection -- We offer strong phishing, spam, and
        spying/tracking\n    protection for all your communications.\n\n**Industry
        Leading Security Features**\n\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers
        using end-to-end encryption at all\ntimes and are transmitted securely between
        Proton servers and user devices.\nThis largely eliminates the risk of message
        interception.\n\n**Zero Access to Your Email Content**\n\nProton Mail''s zero
        access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a\nway that makes
        it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side\nusing an encryption
        key that Proton does not have access to. This means we\ndon''t have the technical
        ability to decrypt your messages.\n\n**Open-Source Cryptography**\n\nProton
        Mail''s open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security\nexperts
        from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection.\nProton
        Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP,\nwhile
        all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using\nopen-source
        libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption\nalgorithms used
        do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\n**Proton Mail in the press:**\n\n\"Proton
        Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption,\nmaking
        it impossible for outside parties to monitor.\" _Forbes_\n\n\"A new email
        service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN\npromises to bring

        To use the Signal desktop app, you must first install Signal on your phone.**\n\nMillions

        in the world. Send and receive high-fidelity messages, participate in HD voice/video
        calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected.
        Signal''s advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you
        can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to
        you.\n\n- Say anything - State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by
        the open source Signal Protocol\u2122) keeps your conversations secure. Privacy
        isn''t an optional mode; it''s just the way that Signal works. Every message,
        every call, every time.\n- Go fast - Messages are delivered quickly and reliably,
        even on slow networks. Signal is optimized to operate in the most constrained
        environment possible.\n- Feel free - Signal is a completely independent 501c3
        nonprofit. Development is supported by users like you. No advertisements.
        No trackers. No kidding.\n- Be yourself - You can use your existing phone

        audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer.\n-
        Whisper in the shadows - Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the
        light.\n\n**Minimize to tray**\n\nPer the request of the Signal developers,
        this snap does not use the system tray by default. This is disabled by default
        per the request of the Signal developers, because system tray support is not
        stable. Set to `false`, Signal will stop when you close it and will not have
        a system tray icon. You can enable it by running the following command.\n\n    snap
        set signal-desktop tray-icon=true\n\n\n**Are you having issues?**\n\nLet us

        is a program which allows you to run a wide variety of classic graphical point-and-click
        adventure games and role-playing games, provided you already have their data
        files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped
        with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never
        designed!\n\nCurrently, ScummVM supports a huge library of adventures with
        over 250 games in total. It supports many classics published by legendary
        studios like LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software, Cyan, Inc. and
        Westwood Studios. Next to ground-breaking titles like the Monkey Island series,
        Broken Sword, Myst, Blade Runner and countless other games you will find some
        really obscure adventures and truly hidden gems to explore.\n\nThis snap is
        maintained by the Snapcrafters community and the ScummVM Team.","developer_validation":"starred","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2020/02/scummvm_icon_512.png","last_updated":"Sat,
