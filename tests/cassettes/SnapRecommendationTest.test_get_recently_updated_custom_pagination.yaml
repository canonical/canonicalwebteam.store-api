        An end-to-end encrypted notes app for digitalists and professionals.\n\nStandard
        Notes helps you gain control in a world that often feels out of control. Protect
        your life''s work with end-to-end encryption, advanced security, and unmatched
        privacy controls.\n\n## A steel vault for your most sensitive data.\n\nStandard
        Notes protects your notes and files with 4x-audited industry-leading end-to-end
        encryption, meaning only you have access to the keys required to decrypt your
        information.\n\nSafely store all your sensitive data in one place and access
        it from all your devices, resting assured that your data is always protected
        by the highest security standards.\n\n## Write fearlessly.\n\nNote-taking
        services like Evernote, Google Keep, Notion, and Simplenote cannot prevent
        employees and governments from reading your data. Standard Notes features
        advanced security measures and privacy controls that protect your data against
        hacks, data breaches, government access, and even employee access.\n\n## Your
        notes and files, always.\n\nNever worry about losing your data again. You''ll
        always have an offline copy of your data, so you can access your notes and
        files even without an internet connection. Automated backups and secure cloud
        sync ensure that your data is safe and sound, even if your device is lost,
        damaged, or stolen.\n\n## Take back your data.\n\nShape-shifting privacy policies
        and unauthorized access by #BigTech and other non-encrypted services can lead
        to leaks, doxing, financial fraud, identity theft, loss of control over your
        information, and other existential harms to you or your business. Safeguard
        your private data with zero-knowledge encryption and open, audited applications
