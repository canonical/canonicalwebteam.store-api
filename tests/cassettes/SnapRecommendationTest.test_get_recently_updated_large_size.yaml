        To use the Signal desktop app, you must first install Signal on your phone.**\n\nMillions

        in the world. Send and receive high-fidelity messages, participate in HD voice/video
        calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected.
        Signal''s advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you
        can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to
        you.\n\n- Say anything - State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by
        the open source Signal Protocol\u2122) keeps your conversations secure. Privacy
        isn''t an optional mode; it''s just the way that Signal works. Every message,
        every call, every time.\n- Go fast - Messages are delivered quickly and reliably,
        even on slow networks. Signal is optimized to operate in the most constrained
        environment possible.\n- Feel free - Signal is a completely independent 501c3
        nonprofit. Development is supported by users like you. No advertisements.
        No trackers. No kidding.\n- Be yourself - You can use your existing phone

        up - Whether they live across town or across the ocean, Signal''s enhanced
        audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer.\n-
        Whisper in the shadows - Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the
        light.\n\n**Minimize to tray**\n\nPer the request of the Signal developers,
        this snap does not use the system tray by default. This is disabled by default
        per the request of the Signal developers, because system tray support is not
        stable. Set to `false`, Signal will stop when you close it and will not have
        a system tray icon. You can enable it by running the following command.\n\n    snap
        set signal-desktop tray-icon=true\n\n\n**Are you having issues?**\n\nLet us
