        even on slow networks. Signal is optimized to operate in the most constrained

        this snap does not use the system tray by default. This is disabled by default
        per the request of the Signal developers, because system tray support is not
        stable. Set to `false`, Signal will stop when you close it and will not have
        a system tray icon. You can enable it by running the following command.\n\n    snap

        your conversations private. Proton Mail is encrypted email from\nSwitzerland.
        Used by millions worldwide, our email application protects your\ncommunications
        and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\n**The Wall Street
        Journal says:**\n\n\"Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually
        impossible for\nanyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.\"\n\n**With
        the Proton Mail desktop application, you can:**\n\n* Manage your Proton Mail
        and Calendar from one application\n* Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n*
        Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n* Keep your inbox
        tidy and clean with folders, labels and with different views\n* Stay productive
        with native desktop notifications\n* Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n*
        Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\n**Why use Proton Mail?**\n\n* Easy to use
        -- Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to\n    read, organize,
        and write your emails.\n* Your inbox is yours -- We don''t spy on your communications
        to show you\n    targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n* Rigorous encryption
        -- Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No\n    one can read
        your emails but you.\n* Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access
        encryption.\n* Unmatched protection -- We offer strong phishing, spam, and
        spying/tracking\n    protection for all your communications.\n\n**Industry
        Leading Security Features**\n\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers
        using end-to-end encryption at all\ntimes and are transmitted securely between
        Proton servers and user devices.\nThis largely eliminates the risk of message
        interception.\n\n**Zero Access to Your Email Content**\n\nProton Mail''s zero
        access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a\nway that makes
        it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side\nusing an encryption
        key that Proton does not have access to. This means we\ndon''t have the technical
        ability to decrypt your messages.\n\n**Open-Source Cryptography**\n\nProton
        Mail''s open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security\nexperts
        from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection.\nProton
        Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP,\nwhile
        all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using\nopen-source
        libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption\nalgorithms used
        do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\n**Proton Mail in the press:**\n\n\"Proton
        Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption,\nmaking
        it impossible for outside parties to monitor.\" _Forbes_\n\n\"A new email

        is the notes app built for handwriting.\n\n\n\nIt''s designed to be as simple
        and intuitive as possible, while still delivering unique features that you''ll
        actually use. Additionally, Saber is available across all your devices, large
        and small, and syncs between them seamlessly.\n\n\n\nNotably, it can invert
        your notes when you''re in dark mode. This allows you to write with white
        ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments
        like when the teacher turns off the lights in class.\nImages and PDFs are
        also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without
        the fuss.\n\n\n\nSaber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from
        anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can
        safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even
        host your own!\n\n\n\nThe app is completely open-source so that anyone can
        view the source code and see exactly what it''s doing and how it handles your
        data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning
        that their inner workings are a mystery to the public.\n\n\n\nAs someone who
        studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with
        other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with
        itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would
        render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read.\nSaber''s
        highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the
        highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper,
        where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency.\n\n\n\nSaber has
        everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders
        inside folders to your heart''s content with no limit on the number of nested
        folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder,
        you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available
        on the home screen.\n\n\n\nDiscover a whole new way to capture and organize
        your thoughts\nwith Saber. Whether you''re a student, professional, or creative\nmind,

        is a parametric 3D modeler. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify
        your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters.
        FreeCAD is open source (LGPL license) and completely modular, allowing for
        very advanced extension and customization.\n\nFreeCAD is multiplatfom, and
        reads and writes many open file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL and others.\n\nVisit
        the upstream project: https://www.freecad.org/ and https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/\n\n**Channels**\n\nThere
        are multiple maintained channels for this snap:\n\n- `stable` stable contains
        the latest upstream release, i.e. the most recent tagged commit. Use this
        if you don''t know what you''re doing.\n- `edge` contains automated (daily)
        builds from the latest master commit. Use this to test new features. Might
        be unstable.\n- `beta` contains automated weekly promotions from edge. Use
        this if you want edge with fewer updates.\n- `candidate` contains release
        candidate (RC) builds. Use this if you want to test release candidates before
        a major release.\n\n\n**Apps/Commands**\n\nThere are multiple apps/commands
        included in the snap:\n\n- `freecad`:               Run FreeCAD\n- `freecad.cmd`:      Run
        FreeCAD command line interface\n- `freecad.pip`:        Install python packages
        for user (not system-wide).  \n                       E.g. `freecad.pip install
        py_slvs` for Assembly3. \n\n\nSide note: There is a FreeCAD experimental branch
        called ''Link branch'' created by a user named ''realthunder'' that has become
        popular. It is available as a Snap package named `freecad-realthunder` (https://snapcraft.io/freecad-realthunder).","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2024/09/FreeCAD_Logo.svg.png","last_updated":"Sat,

        is a high level, high performance, dynamic language for technical computing.\n\nJulia
        is **fast**: It was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia
        programs JIT compile to efficient native code for multiple systems and architectures
        via LLVM.\n\nJulia is **general**: It uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm,
        making it easy to express object oriented and functional programming patterns.
        The standard library provides asynchronous I/O, process control, logging,
        profiling, a package manager, and more. In addition, there is a rich ecosystem
        of over 10,000 packages and counting across a number of domains.\n\nJulia
        is **easy to use**: It has high level syntax and is dynamically typed, providing
        accessibility for programmers of all backgrounds and experience levels, and
        making it feel like a scripting language.\n\nJulia is **optionally typed**:
        It has an extensive, flexible, and extensible type system, and type declarations
        can be used to clarify and solidify programs. But type declarations are not
        required for general use.\n\nJulia is **open source**: It''s free for anyone

        http://127.0.0.1:3002, etc)\n\n**Additional notes**\n\nIn case you want to
        use the VPN on demand feature, you have to execute also:\n* sudo sh -c ''echo
        tun >> /etc/modules''\n* sudo modprobe tun\n\nIn case Uncomplicated Firewall
        (UFW) is configured on your machine, you might consider allowing the usage
        of the port where the Collector Web Interface is available. For instance running
        the following command:\n* sudo ufw allow 3000","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2019/03/new_domotz_icon.png","last_updated":"Fri,

        A.D. (pronounced \u201czero-ey-dee\u201d) is a free, open-source, historical\nReal

        you must gather the resources\nyou need to raise a military force and dominate

        existed: In the usual calendar,\none goes from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. and skips
        zero. This reflects the historical\nfiction in the game: Who would have won
        if all the factions were pitted\nagainst each other when each of them was
        at its prime?\n.\nWe intend to portray some of the major civilizations over
        the millennium of\n500 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Hence the midpoint, zero.) That is
        an ambitious prospect,\nso in the first edition of 0 A.D. we focus on the
        last five centuries B.C.\nPerhaps in future expansion packs, more civilizations
        will be added,\nalong with additional gameplay features.\n.\nWe put a strong
        emphasis on historical accuracy while developing 0 A.D.\nWe plan all our units
        and all our buildings based on reconstructions of how\nthe units and the buildings
        might have looked like in the ancient world.\nWe even name them in the original
        languages, such as Greek and Latin.\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that

        the package registry to publish it for docker, npm and many other package
        managers.\n* Customizable: Want to change your look? Change some settings?
        There are many config switches to make Forgejo work exactly like you want.\n*
