        devices. One of the world''s top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million
        active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market,
        connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around
        the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets
        and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don\u2019t need
        to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message
        from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media
        and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history
        will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in
        the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission
        to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram,
        including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit
        symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman
        secure key exchange.\n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented
        and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove
        the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.\n\nPOWERFUL:
        You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos,
        documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even
        set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online
        communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your
        messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging
        system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.\n\nFUN:
        Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and
        emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and
        an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE:
        While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to
        keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use
        it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third
        parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received
        for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your
        data to show you ads.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can
        do with a messaging app. Don\u2019t wait years for older messengers to catch
        up with Telegram \u2014 join the revolution today.","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2018/02/icon256.png","last_updated":"Wed,

        calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected.
        Signal''s advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you
        can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to
        you.\n\n- Say anything - State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by
        the open source Signal Protocol\u2122) keeps your conversations secure. Privacy
        isn''t an optional mode; it''s just the way that Signal works. Every message,
        every call, every time.\n- Go fast - Messages are delivered quickly and reliably,
        even on slow networks. Signal is optimized to operate in the most constrained
        environment possible.\n- Feel free - Signal is a completely independent 501c3
        nonprofit. Development is supported by users like you. No advertisements.
        No trackers. No kidding.\n- Be yourself - You can use your existing phone
        number and address book to securely communicate with your friends.\n- Speak
        up - Whether they live across town or across the ocean, Signal''s enhanced
        audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer.\n-
        Whisper in the shadows - Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the

        this snap does not use the system tray by default. This is disabled by default
        per the request of the Signal developers, because system tray support is not
        stable. Set to `false`, Signal will stop when you close it and will not have
        a system tray icon. You can enable it by running the following command.\n\n    snap

        snap connect obs-studio:alsa\n   sudo snap connect obs-studio:audio-record\n   sudo
        snap connect obs-studio:avahi-control\n   sudo snap connect obs-studio:camera\n   sudo
        snap connect obs-studio:jack1\n   sudo snap connect obs-studio:kernel-module-observe\n\n**NDI**\n\nIf
        you want to use the NDI plugin you''ll need to connect the Avahi Control interface.\n\n   snap
        connect obs-studio:avahi-control\n\n**Virtual Camera**\n\nStarting with OBS
        26.1.0, Virtual Camera support is integrated. Here''s how to install and configure
        `v4l2loopback`:\n\n   sudo snap connect obs-studio:kernel-module-observe\n   sudo
        apt -y install v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils\n   echo \"options v4l2loopback
        devices=1 video_nr=13 card_label=''OBS Virtual Camera''    exclusive_caps=1\"
        | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf\n   echo \"v4l2loopback\" | sudo
        tee /etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf\n   sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback\n   sudo
        modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=13 card_label=''OBS Virtual Camera''
        exclusive_caps=1\n\n**NOTE!** Using `video_nr` greater than 64 will not work.\n\n**Removable

        is how the Input Overlay plugin looks when correctly installed:\n\n   /home/username/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500
        input-overlay\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 bin\n       \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500
        64bit\n       \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 input-overlay.so\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500
        data\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 locale\n               \u251c\u2500\u2500
        de-DE.ini\n               \u251c\u2500\u2500 en-US.ini\n               \u2514\u2500\u2500
        ru-RU.ini\n\nIf you want to use the Input Overlay plugin, you''ll also need
        to connect the joystick interface:\n\n   snap connect obs-studio:joystick\n\n**NOTE:

        A.D. (pronounced \u201czero-ey-dee\u201d) is a free, open-source, historical\nReal
        Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire Games,\na
        global group of volunteer game developers.\nAs the leader of an ancient civilization,
        you must gather the resources\nyou need to raise a military force and dominate
        your enemies.\n.\n\u201c0 A.D.\u201d is a time period that never actually
        existed: In the usual calendar,\none goes from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. and skips
        zero. This reflects the historical\nfiction in the game: Who would have won
        if all the factions were pitted\nagainst each other when each of them was
        at its prime?\n.\nWe intend to portray some of the major civilizations over
        the millennium of\n500 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Hence the midpoint, zero.) That is
        an ambitious prospect,\nso in the first edition of 0 A.D. we focus on the
        last five centuries B.C.\nPerhaps in future expansion packs, more civilizations
        will be added,\nalong with additional gameplay features.\n.\nWe put a strong
        emphasis on historical accuracy while developing 0 A.D.\nWe plan all our units
        and all our buildings based on reconstructions of how\nthe units and the buildings
        might have looked like in the ancient world.\nWe even name them in the original
        languages, such as Greek and Latin.\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that
        any game should be fun to play, so,\nin many cases, we preferred playability
        over historical accuracy.","developer_validation":"verified","icon":"https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/site_media/appmedia/2017/12/icon256_f9302jP.png","last_updated":"Tue,
